# Preface

Welcome to the Computational Geosciences resource at the University of Stavanger, Norway (UiS). Computational Geosciences is not a new subject. A course in Computational Geology was offered at the University of South Florida for the first time in 1996 (Vacher, 2000). Computational Geosciences makes connections between mathematics, computation and geology. It promotes a mathematical problem-solving disposition (Vacher, 2000).

This resource is designed based on the same principles and with emphasis on problem-solving. However, the access to data and the tools to visualize and analize data have improved tremendously over the last 20 years. Today, a geologist carrying a mobile device in the field has access to a collection of sensors collecting data in real time (magnetometer, accelerometers, gravity, GPS, etc.), and accurate databases of topography, aerial photos, and satellite imagery. Such information not only supports the geologist in the field, but also allows her to test hypotheses and take decisions. Computation is greatly facilitated by high-level programming languages (e.g. Matlab and Python) that focus on solving and visualizing problems, rather than on coding details. The digital era is here, and to analyze the large number of data associated with it, we need math and computing.

To develop this resource, we put together an interesting group of faculty from the Departments of Energy Resources (IER) and Mechanical and Structural Engineering (IMBM) at the University of Stavanger, with expertise in Geographic Information Science (GIS, Lisa Watson, IER), Geophysics (Wiktor Weibull, IER), Structural Geology (Nestor Cardozo, IER), and Fluid Mechanics (Knut Giljarhus, IMBM). Postdoc David Oakley (IER) also contributed to the resource. Master students from Computational Engineering (Angela Hoch), Offshore Engineering (Adham Amer), and Geosciences (Vania Mansoor and Linda Olsen) were instrumental. They wrote our scattered code into functions and notebooks, solved the exercise problems, and helped editing the resource in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

Python is the programming language of choice. The resource consists of ten chapters covering an introduction to computation in Geosciences and Python ([Chapter 1](ch01)), understanding location ([Chapter 2](ch02)), orientation and display of geological features ([Chapter 3](ch03)), coordinate systems and vectors ([Chapter 4](ch04)), coordinate transformations ([Chapter 5](ch05)), tensors ([Chapter 6](ch06)), stress ([Chapter 7](ch07)), strain ([Chapter 8](ch08)), elasticity ([Chapter 9](ch09)), and the inverse problem (Chapter 10). Each chapter describes the basic theory before going directly into applications and problems. Exercises at the end of each chapter are essential to master the material. These exercises are not trivial.

Much of the material is based on the book Structural Geology Algorithms: Vectors and Tensors (Allmendinger et al., 2012), and the lab manual: Modern Structural Practice (Allmendinger, 2020). However, we have also included additional GIS and Geophysics topics. The resource is focused on our areas of expertise, but the material can be applied to other areas.

You can download or subscribe to changes in the resource using its [git repository](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo). We hope you enjoy this resource and learn from it, as well as use it for teaching and research. We also hope to spark enough interest for users to contribute to the resource with additional material. Finally, we are grateful to the Faculty of Science and Technology at the University of Stavanger for sponsoring this project. We also like to thank Artem Mostalenko (Saint Petersburg U.) and Rustam Zaitov for careful review of the resource and code suggestions. Associate Professor Alex F. Antunes, from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte/Brazil, implemented the resource as a Jupyter Book, as well as translated the material to Portuguese.
