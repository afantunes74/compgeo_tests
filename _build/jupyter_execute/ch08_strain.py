# Stresses acting through time within the Earth can lead to deformation. Deformation is more complicated than stress because it involves the comparison of states of the rock material at two different points in time. Therefore, one needs to establish both temporal and spatial reference frames. This chapter covers deformation and strain, including infinitesimal, finite, and progressive strain. This is a relatively long and complicated material, it comprises several chapters in classical books such as Ramsay (1967) and Means (1976). However, our purpose is not to discuss in detail the theory of strain, but rather introduce some interesting strain problems in geosciences, and their computation.

# (ch08-1)=
# ## Deformation and strain
# 
# Strictly speaking, deformation involves rigid body deformation (translation and rotation), and non-rigid body deformation (changes in shape and volume) or strain. In geology, rigid-body deformation is rather difficult to determine, with a few exceptions (e.g. paleolatitude of a continent from paleomagnetic pole). We often just focus on strain.
# 
# Consider the deformation shown in {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`. The square and inscribed circle ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`a) are first translated, then rotated, and then sheared. The translation vector **t** ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`b) and rotation $\omega$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`c) describe the first stage of rigid body-deformation. Shear of the objects defines the second stage of non-rigid body deformation or strain ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`d).

# ```{figure} /figures/ch08_fig01.png
# :width: 400px
# :name: ch08_fig01
# 
# Deformation of a square of side $l_{i}$ and inscribed circle. **a.** Initial configuration. **b.** Translation $\textbf{t}$. **c.** Rotation $\omega$. **d.** Shear. $l_{f}$ and $\psi$ are the final length and angular shear of the long side of the parallelogram. Red and blue lines in ellipse are principal axes and lines of no finite elongation (LNFE), respectively.
# ```

# The changes in shape (distortion) of the bodies can be described by the changes in length and angle of lines. If the initial length of a line is $l_i$, and the deformed length of the line is $l_f$, the change in length of the line can be defined by either one of the following parameters:

# $$
# \begin{gathered}
#     e = \frac{l_f-l_i}{l_i} \\
#     S = \frac{l_f}{l_i} = 1 + e \\
#     \lambda = S^2 = (1+e)^2
# \end{gathered}
# $$ (ch08_eq01)

# where $e$ is elongation, $S$ is stretch, and $\lambda$ is quadratic elongation. For the long side of the parallelogram in {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`d, $e$ is positive, and $S$ and $\lambda$ are larger than $1$. For the short side, $e$ is negative, and $S$ and $\lambda$ are lower than $1$. Lines that have their original length have $e = 0$, and $S$ and $\lambda = 1$ (blue lines, {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`d). Notice than $e$ cannot be lower than $-1$, and $S$ and $\lambda$ cannot be lower than 0 (a line canâ€™t be shortened more than its original length).
# 
# Changes in angle are measured by the angular shear $\psi$, which is the change in angle between two originally perpendicular lines ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`d). From the angular shear, one can calculate the shear strain $\gamma$:

# $$
# \gamma = \tan\psi
# $$ (ch08_eq02)

# Changes in area or volume (dilation) can be described using the areal or volumetric stretch:

# $$
# \begin{gathered}
#     S_A = \frac{A_f}{A_i} \\
#     S_V = \frac{V_f}{V_i}
# \end{gathered}
# $$ (ch08_eq03)

# where $A_i$ and $A_f$ are initial and final area, and $V_i$ and $V_f$ are initial and final volume. We can also determine areal or volumetric elongation.
# 
# In this chapter, we make two major assumptions about strain: Strain is continuous (it is distributed uniformly across the body), and strain is homogeneous (it is identical across the body). Clearly these assumptions are incorrect: Rocks are full of discontinuities, and geological structures (e.g. folds) exhibit heterogeneous strain. However at the appropriate scale, rocks can be described as continuum materials, and the heterogeneous strain of geological structures can be represented by domains of homogeneous (yet compatible) strain. This makes possible applying homogeneous strain to geological deformation.
# 
# For homogeneous strain, straight lines remain straight, parallel lines remain parallel, and circles become ellipses in 2D, or spheres become ellipsoids in 3D ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`d). The resultant ellipse (or ellipsoid) is called the strain ellipse (or ellipsoid). The stretches along the axes of this ellipse (or ellipsoid, red lines in {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`d) are called the principal stretches, and they are denoted by the symbols $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$, for the maximum, intermediate, and minimum principal stretch, respectively. The volumetric stretch can also be defined as:

# $$
# S_V = S_1S_2S_3
# $$ (ch08_eq04)

# The deformation in {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>` is volume and area constant ($S_V$ and $S_A = 1$). Under this condition, there are two lines in the strain ellipse that have their original length (blue lines, {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig01>`d). These lines are known as the lines of no finite elongation (LNFE).

# (ch08-2)=
# ## Deformation and displacement gradients
# 
# Consider the deformation shown in {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig02>`. The cube is transformed into a brick-shaped body. It is shortened along the $\mathbf{X_2}$ axis by half ($e = -0.5$, $S = 0.5$), and it is stretched along the $\mathbf{X_3}$ axis twice ($e = 1$, $S = 2$).

# ```{figure} /figures/ch08_fig02.png

# 
# Deformation of a cube in to a brick-shaped body. The principal axes of strain are parallel to the coordinate axes before $\textbf{X}$ and after $\textbf{x}$ deformation. Modified from Means (1976).
# ```

# We can express the deformed coordinates $\mathbf{x}$ of any point in the cuboid in terms of the undeformed coordinates $\mathbf{X}$ of the same point in the cube:
# 
# :::{note}
# By convention, we use $\mathbf{X}$ to refer to the undeformed coordinates, and $\mathbf{x}$ to denote the deformed coordinates.
# :::

# $$
# \begin{gathered}
#     x_1 = 1 X_1 + 0 X_2 + 0 X_3 \\
#     x_2 = 0 X_1 + 0.5 X_2 + 0 X_3 \\
#     x_3 = 0 X_1 + 0 X_2 + 2 X_3
# \end{gathered}
# $$ (ch08_eq05)

# Likewise, we can express the undeformed coordinates $\mathbf{X}$ of any point in the cube in terms of the deformed coordinates $\mathbf{x}$ of the same point in the cuboid:

# $$
# \begin{gathered}
#     X_1 = 1 x_1 + 0 x_2 + 0 x_3 \\
#     X_2 = 0 x_1 + 2 x_2 + 0 x_3 \\
#     X_3 = 0 x_1 + 0 x_2 + 0.5 x_3
# \end{gathered}
# $$ (ch08_eq06)

# Equations {eq}`ch08_eq05` and {eq}`ch08_eq06` are called *coordinate transformations*, but they are fundamentally different from the transformation of coordinate axes in [Chapter 5](ch05). The coordinate transformations here are between two different states in time. Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq05` is called a *Green* transformation (new in terms of old), while Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq06` is a *Cauchy* transformation (old in terms of new).
# 
# We can take the partial derivatives of these equations, which are just the coefficients of the equations:

# $$
# \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_j}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&0.5&0\\0&0&2\end{bmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq07)

# and:

# $$
# \frac{\partial X_i}{\partial x_j}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&2&0\\0&0&0.5\end{bmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq08)

# These partial derivatives are known as the deformation gradients and unlike the coordinate transformations, they are homogeneous and independent of the coordinate axes (i.e. they are tensors). Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq07` is called the *Green* deformation gradient, while Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq08` is the *Cauchy* deformation gradient. Since in {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig02>` the principal axes of strain are parallel to the coordinate axes, we can easily see one thing: The components of the Green deformation gradient are the stretches along the coordinate axes, and the components of the Cauchy deformation gradient are the inverse of the stretches along the coordinate axes. For more complex situations this will not be the case, but in general the Green and Cauchy deformation gradient tensors are related to the stretch (Allmendinger et al., 2012).
# 
# Another way to study the deformation is to look at the displacement $\mathbf{u}$ between the undeformed and deformed states ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig02>`). The displacement can either be expressed in the undeformed configuration:

# $$
# \begin{gathered}
#     u_1 = 0 X_1 + 0 X_2 + 0 X_3 \\
#     u_2 = 0 X_1 - 0.5 X_2 + 0 X_3 \\
#     u_3 = 0 X_1 + 0 X_2 + 1 X_3
# \end{gathered}
# $$ (ch08_eq09)

# or in the deformed configuration:

# $$
# \begin{gathered}
#     u_1 = 0 x_1 + 0 x_2 + 0 x_3 \\
#     u_2 = 0 x_1 - 1 x_2 + 0 x_3 \\
#     u_3 = 0 x_1 + 0 x_2 + 0.5 x_3
# \end{gathered}
# $$ (ch08_eq10)

# Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq09` is known as the *Lagrangian* displacement (in terms of old coordinates), while Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq09` is the *Eulerian* displacement (in terms of new coordinates). We can take the partial derivatives of these equations, which are just the coefficients of the equations:

# $$
# \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_j}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0\\0&-0.5&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq11)

# and:

# $$
# \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0\\0&-1&0\\0&0&0.5\end{bmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq12)

# These partial derivatives are known as the displacement gradients and unlike the displacement, they are homogeneous and independent of the coordinate axes (i.e. they are tensors). Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq11` is called the *Lagrangian* displacement gradient, while Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq12` is the *Eulerian* displacement gradient. For the case of {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig02>`, we can see that the components of the Lagrangian displacement gradient are the elongations along the coordinate axes, while the components of the Eulerian displacement gradient are the elongations along the coordinate axes with respect to the deformed reference frame ($\tilde{e}=(l_f-l_i)/l_f$). This will not be the case for more complicated situations, but in general the Lagrangian and Eulerian displacement gradient tensors are related to the elongation (Allmendinger et al., 2012).

# (ch08-3)=
# ## Infinitesimal strain
# 
# Suppose that a line parallel to the $\mathbf{X_1}$ axis is elongated 1$\%$ of its initial length. In this case the displacement gradient is:

# $$
# \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial X_1} = \frac{0.01}{1.0} = 0.01 \quad\quad \text{and} \quad\quad \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1} = \frac{0.01}{1.01} = 0.0099
# $$ (ch08_eq13)

# Thus, when strains are small ($e < 1\%$), $\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_i} \approx \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_i}$, and the difference between the displacement gradient in the initial or final state is insignificant. Small strains are called *infinitesimal strains*, and they are important in a number of fields in geosciences, particularly in geophysics.
# 
# For infinitesimal strain, the distinction between old and new coordinates is irrelevant, and therefore we can just use one column in {numref}`ch08_tab01`. The displacement gradient $\mathbf{e}$ is an asymmetric tensor, and it can be decomposed into a symmetric and an antisymmetric tensor (Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq14`):
# 
# :::{note}
# We use $\mathbf{e}$ to denote the displacement gradient. This is different than the non-bold italic letter $e$ which is used for elongation.
# :::

# $$
# e_{ij} = \varepsilon_{ij} + \omega_{ij}
# $$ (ch08_eq14)

# where:

# $$\label{eq8.14} \varepsilon_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}(e_{ij}+e_{ji})=\begin{bmatrix}e_{11}&\frac{e_{12}+e_{21}}{2}&\frac{e_{13}+e_{31}}{2}\\ \frac{e_{21}+e_{12}}{2}&e_{22}&\frac{e_{23}+e_{32}}{2}\\ \frac{e_{31}+e_{13}}{2}&\frac{e_{32}+e_{23}}{2}&e_{33}\end{bmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq15)

# and:

# $$
# \omega_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}(e_{ij}-e_{ji})=\begin{bmatrix}0&\frac{e_{12}-e_{21}}{2}&\frac{e_{13}-e_{31}}{2}\\ \frac{e_{21}-e_{12}}{2}&0&\frac{e_{23}-e_{32}}{2}\\ \frac{e_{31}-e_{13}}{2}&\frac{e_{32}-e_{23}}{2}&0\end{bmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq16)

# The symmetric tensor $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is called the strain tensor. The diagonal, $\varepsilon_{ii}$, terms of this tensor correspond to the elongations along the axes of the reference system, and the off-diagonal terms, $\varepsilon_{ij}$, correspond to half the shear strain ($\varepsilon_{ij} = \frac{\gamma_{ij}}{2}$). Like any symmetric tensor, the strain tensor has three principal axes which can be determined by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the tensor ([Section 6.2](ch06-2)). These principal axes define the infinitesimal strain ellipsoid.
# 
# The antisymmetric tensor $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is also known as an axial vector. The Cartesian coordinates, $r_i$, of this vector give the orientation of the rotation axis:

# $$
# r_1=\frac{-(\omega_{23}-\omega_{32})}{2}\quad r_2=\frac{-(-\omega_{13}+\omega_{31})}{2}\quad \text{and}\quad r_3=\frac{-(\omega_{12}-\omega_{21})}{2}
# $$ (ch08_eq17)

# The amount of rotation in radians is just the length of the vector $\mathbf{r}$:

# $$
# \omega = \vert \mathbf{r}\vert = \sqrt{r_1^2+r_2^2+r_3^2}
# $$ (ch08_eq18)

# The function [inf_strain](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/inf_strain.py) computes the infinitesimal strain and rotation tensors from a displacement gradient. It also outputs the principal strains, and the components and amount of rotation:

# ### Mohr circle for infinitesimal strain
# 
# As discussed in [Section 6.4.1](ch06-4-1), the rotation of the infinitesimal strain tensor about one principal axis can be represented by a Mohr circle. We start with the infinitesimal strain tensor in principal coordinates:

# $$
# \varepsilon_{ij}=\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon_1&0&0\\ 0&\varepsilon_2&0\\ 0&0&\varepsilon_3\end{bmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq19)

# and perform a rotation $\theta$ about $\mathbf{X_2}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig03>`a), which is described by the transformation matrix:

# $$
# a_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta&0&\sin\theta\\0&1&0\\-\sin\theta&0&\cos\theta\end{pmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq20)

# The tensor transformation equation is:

# $$
# \varepsilon_{ij}' = a_{ik}a_{jl}\varepsilon_{kl}
# $$ (ch08_eq21)

# which results in the new form of the strain tensor:

# $$
# \varepsilon'_{ij}=\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon_1\cos^2\theta+\varepsilon_3\sin^2\theta&0&-(\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_3)\sin\theta\cos\theta\\0&\varepsilon_2&0\\-(\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_3)\sin\theta\cos\theta&0&\varepsilon_1\sin^2\theta+\varepsilon_3\cos^2\theta\end{bmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq22)

# 
# Rotation of the infinitesimal strain tensor about principal axis $\mathbf{X_2}$. **a.** Physical plane representation, **b.** Mohr circle representation. Modified from Allmendinger et al. (2012).
# ```

# Upon rearranging, we get:

# $$
# \begin{gathered}
#     \varepsilon_{11}'=\frac{\varepsilon_1+\varepsilon_3}{2}+\frac{\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_3}{2}\cos 2\theta \\
#     \varepsilon_{33}'=\frac{\varepsilon_1+\varepsilon_3}{2}-\frac{\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_3}{2}\cos 2\theta \\
#     \varepsilon_{13}'=\varepsilon_{31}'=\frac{\gamma}{2}=-\frac{\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_3}{2}\sin 2\theta
# \end{gathered}
# $$ (ch08_eq23)

# which are the equations of the Mohr circle for infinitesimal strain ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig03>`b). This Mohr circle is not very useful, but perhaps the most important thing illustrated by it is that the two directions of maximum shear strain are at $\pm$<!-- -->45to the principal axes, $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_3$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig03>`b). Turning this around for the infinitesimal strain in a shear zone, the infinitesimal shortening and extension directions are always at 45to the shear zone. For example, veins and foliations at the edge of a shear zone, and P and T axes of earthquakes ([Section 8.3.2](ch08-3-2)) are all oriented 45to the shear (fault) zone ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig04>`).

# ```{figure} /figures/ch08_fig04.png

# ### Applications of Infinitesimal Strain
# 
# (ch08-3-2-1)=
# #### **P** and **T** axes
# 
# Our first application is based on the observation we just made regarding the orientation of the principal axes of infinitesimal strain with respect to a shear zone ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig04>`). In a fault, the infinitesimal shortening **P** and extension **T** axes are at 45$^o$ to the slip vector (e.g. fault striae), and they lie on the plane defined by the fault striae and the fault pole. This plane is known as the movement plane $M$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig05>`).

# ```{figure} /figures/ch08_fig05.png

# :name: ch08_fig05
# 
# **a.** Reverse fault, striae and movement plane $M$. **b.** Representation of **a** on a lower hemisphere equal area stereonet. Modified from Marshak and Mitra (1988).
# ```

# The displacement gradient tensor, $e_{ij}$ of a population of $n$ small faults with poles vectors, $p_i$, and slip vectors, $u_i$, is given by (Allmendinger et al., 2012):

# $$
# e_{ij}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(M_{g} u_{i} p_{j}\right)}{V}
# $$ (ch08_eq24)

# where $M_g$ is the geometric moment and $V$ is the volume of the region being deformed. As discussed in [Section 8.3](ch08.3), we can decompose this equation to yield the infinitesimal strain and rotation tensors:

# $$
# e_{i j}=\varepsilon_{i j}+\omega_{i j}=\frac{M_{g}\left(u_{i} p_{j}+u_{j} p_{i}\right)}{2 V}+\frac{M_{g}\left(u_{i} p_{j}-u_{j} p_{i}\right)}{2 V}
# $$ (ch08_eq25)

# Because $M_g/2V$ is a scalar, the orientations of the principal axes of infinitesimal strain are identical to the principal axes of the symmetric tensor $(u_i p_j+u_j p_i)$, which are just a function of the fault planes and striae orientations. The **P** and **T** axes are therefore a simple, direct representation of fault geometry and the orientation and sense of slip (Allmendinger et al., 1989).
# 
# The function [pt_axes](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/pt_axes.py) computes and plots the **P** and **T** axes from the orientation of several faults and their slip vectors:

# Here, the overall shortening direction given by the **P** axes (blue dots) is about E-W. From the **P** and **T** axes, it is possible to calculate a moment tensor summation and the kinematic axes, which define two nodal planes separating the regions of extension (**T** axes) and shortening (**P** axes). The regions of extension are typically shaded, and so the diagram looks like a beach ball ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig04>`c). Beach ball diagrams are also used to display the focal mechanisms of earthquakes, where P-waves first arrivals pushing the ground up are marked as **T** axes, and those pushing the ground down are marked as **P** axes. We leave the moment tensor summation for the Exercises section.

# #### 2D strain from GPS data
# 
# The global positioning system (GPS) has revolutionized Earth sciences by providing geoscientists with real time monitoring of active deformation. Continuous GPS measurements provide mm resolution of the displacement of stations. Because the changes in distance between stations is very small (10s of mm) relative to the distance between stations (10s of km), the strains measured by GPS networks are infinitesimal. {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig06>` shows this problem in two dimensions:

# ```{figure} /figures/ch08_fig06.png
# :width: 450px
# :name: ch08_fig06
# 
# Three points in an initial configuration $\textbf{X}$ move along non-parallel vectors $\textbf{u}$ to a final configuration $\textbf{x}$, resulting in strain. Modified from Allmendinger et al. (2012).
# ```

# If the strain is homogeneous, the displacement of the stations is expressed by the following equation:

# $$
# u_{i}=t_{i}+e_{i j} X_{j}
# $$ (ch08_eq26)

# where $t_i$ is the translation vector and $e_{ij}$ is the displacement gradient tensor. In matrix form, this equation can be written as:

# $$
# \left[\begin{array}{c}{ }^{1} u_1 \\ { }^{1} u_{2} \\ { }^{2} u_{1} \\ { }^{2} u_{2} \\ \cdots \\ \cdots \\ { }^{n} u_{1} \\ { }^{n} u_{2}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}1 & 0 & { }^{1} X_{1} & { }^{1} X_{2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & { }^{1} X_{1} & { }^{1} X_{2} \\ 1 & 0 & { }^{2} X_{1} & { }^{2} X_{2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & { }^{2} X_{1} & { }^{2} X_{2} \\ \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\ \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\ 1 & 0 & { }^{n} X_{1} & { }^{n} X_{2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & { }^{n} X_{1} & { }^{n} X_{2}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{l}t_{1} \\ t_{2} \\ e_{11} \\ e_{12} \\ e_{21} \\ e_{22}\end{array}\right]
# $$ (ch08_eq27)

# where the superscripts 1 to $n$ refer to the stations. The column vector to the right of Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq27` contains the unknowns, which are the two components of the translation vector ($t_1$ and $t_2$) and the four components of the displacement gradient tensor ($e_{11}$, $e_{12}$, $e_{21}$ and $e_{22}$). Therefore, in 2D there are 6 unknowns, and since each station delivers 2 equations, we need a minimum of 3 non-colinear stations to determine the strain ellipse.
# 
# :::{note}
# In 3D there are 12 unknowns and each station delivers 3 equations. Therefore, we need a minimum of 4 non-colinear stations to determine the strain ellipsoid.
# :::
# 
# Notice that Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq27` is written not just for 3 stations but for $n$ stations. If there are more than 3 stations in 2D (or 4 stations in 3D), the system is overdetermined (more equations than unknowns), and we can use the extra information to assess the uncertainties of the model parameters.
# 
# The solution to Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq27` is a classical application of inverse theory, specifically the solution of the linear least-squares problem (Press et al., 1986). This problem has the form:

# $$
# \mathbf{y}=\mathbf{M} \mathbf{x}
# $$ (ch08_eq28)

# where **y** is the vector with known displacements, **M** is the matrix with the location of the stations (this matrix is known as the design matrix), and **x** is the vector with the unknowns. To solve for **x**, **y** is multiplied by the inverse of **M**:

# $$
# \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{M}^{-1} \mathbf{y}
# $$ (ch08_eq29)

# In Matlab or Python, there are routines specifically designed to solve this problem. We use the function [lscov](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/lscov.py) by Paul MÃ¼ller to solve this problem.
# 
# There are three main strategies to compute the strain from a network of stations: i. To calculate the strain on triangular cells whose vertices are defined by the stations (Delaunay triangulation), ii. To calculate the strain on a regular grid of cells, using the stations within a radius, $r$, from the center of each cell (nearest neighbor method), or iii. To calculate the strain on a regular grid of cells, using all the stations weighted by their distance to the center of each cell (distance weighted method; Cardozo and Allmendinger; 2009). In this last case, the weighting factor is given by:

# $$
# W=\exp \left[\frac{-d^{2}}{2 \alpha^{2}}\right]
# $$ (ch08_eq30)

# where $d$ is the distance from the station to the center of the cell, and $\alpha$ is a constant that specifies how the impact of a station decays with distance. A larger value of $\alpha$ smooths out local variations.
# 
# The function [grid_strain](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/grid_strain.py) computes and plots the infinitesimal strain of a network of GPS stations. Notice that after computing the displacement gradient for each cell, we use the function `inf_strain` to compute the strain:

# Given the uneven distribution of the stations, the distance weighted method is perhaps the best representation of the infinitesimal strain. The rotation is about a downward vertical axis. The GPS-based rotation shows large coherent domains of clockwise (positive) and counterclockwise (negative) rotation. Interestingly enough, these domains are consistent with the permanent, long-term deformation of this region (Allmendinger et al., 2007).

# (ch08-4)=
# ## Finite strain
# 
# When deformations are large, the initial and final states are not identical:

# $$
# d X_{i} \neq d x_{i} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial X_{i}} \neq \frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{i}}
# $$ (ch08_eq31)

# and therefore, we need to use all the tensors in {numref}`ch08_tab01`.
# 
# The mathematics of finite strain is quite involved (e.g. Means, 1976; Allmendinger et al., 2012) and we will not cover it in detail here. Rather, we will focus on the main tensors required to compute finite strain. We start with the finite strain tensor in the undeformed configuration:

# $$
# E_{i j}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial X_{j}}+\frac{\partial u_{j}}{\partial X_{i}}+\frac{\partial u_{k}}{\partial X_{i}} \frac{\partial u_{k}}{\partial X_{j}}\right]=\frac{1}{2}\left[e_{i j}+e_{j i}+e_{k i} e_{k j}\right]
# $$ (ch08_eq32)

# where $E_{ij}$ is known as the *Lagrangian finite strain tensor*. Similarly, we can compute the finite strain tensor in the deformed configuration:

# $$
# \bar{E}_{i j}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}+\frac{\partial u_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}-\frac{\partial u_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \frac{\partial u_{k}}{\partial x_{j}}\right]=\frac{1}{2}\left[\bar{e}_{i j}+\bar{e}_{j i}-\bar{e}_{k i} \bar{e}_{k j}\right]
# $$ (ch08_eq33)

# where $\bar{E}_{i j}$ is known as the *Eulerian finite strain tensor.
# 
# :::{note}
# We use an upper bar to denote tensors in the deformed configuration, e.g. $\bar{e}_{ij}$ and $\bar{E}_{ij}$.
# :::
# 
# Notice that Eqs. {eq}`ch08_eq29` and {eq}`ch08_eq30` are similar to Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq15` for the infinitesimal strain tensor, but with an extra term ($e_{k i} e_{k j}$ or $\bar{e}_{k i} \bar{e}_{k j}$).
# 
# From the deformation gradient $\mathbf{F}$, we can also compute deformation tensors. In the undeformed configuration:

# $$
# C_{i j}=\frac{\partial x_{k}}{\partial X_{i}} \frac{\partial x_{k}}{\partial X_{j}}=F_{k i} F_{k j}
# $$ (ch08_eq34)

# where $C_{ij}$ is known as the *Green deformation tensor*. Similarly, for the deformed configuration:

# $$
# \bar{C}_{i j}=\frac{\partial X_{k}}{\partial x_{i}} \frac{\partial X_{k}}{\partial x_{j}}=\bar{F}_{k i} \bar{F}_{k j}
# $$ (ch08_eq35)

# where $\bar{C}_{i j}$ is known as the *Cauchy deformation tensor*.
# 
# The finite strain and deformation tensors are related. In the undeformed configuration:

# $$
# E_{i j}=\frac{1}{2}\left(C_{i j}-\delta_{i j}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad C_{i j}=\delta_{i j}+2 E_{i j}
# $$ (ch08_eq36)

# and in the deformed configuration:

# $$
# \bar{E}_{i j}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta_{i j}-\bar{C}_{i j}\right) \quad \text { and } \quad \bar{C}_{i j}=\delta_{i j}-2 \bar{E}_{i j}
# $$ (ch08_eq37)

# where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, a function that returns 1 if $i = j$, or 0 otherwise.
# 
# Thus, the finite strain tensors do not contain any more information than the deformation tensors, and viceversa. They are all symmetric tensors that have principal axes and can be represented by Mohr circles (see next section). From Eqs. {eq}`ch08_eq36` and {eq}`ch08_eq37`, it is clear that $E_{ij}$ and $C_{ij}$ have the same principal axes orientations. This is also the case for $\bar{E}_{ij}$ and $\bar{C}_{ij}$. In addition these tensors are related to the quadratic elongation, $\lambda_i$, along the coordinate axes:

# $$
# \lambda_{i}=C_{i i}=1+2 E_{i i}
# $$ (ch08_eq38)

# and:

# $$
# \frac{1}{\lambda_{i}}=\bar{C}_{i i}=1-2 \bar{E}_{i i}
# $$ (ch08_eq39)

# {numref}`ch08_tab02` shows the finite strain and deformation tensors for the deformation in {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig02>`.

# ```{list-table} Finite strain and deformation tensors for Figure 8.2.

# ```

# You can see that the diagonal components of the Green deformation tensor, $C_{ij}$, are the quadratic elongations, $\lambda_i$, along the coordinate axes, and the diagonal components of the Cauchy deformation tensor, $\bar{C}_{ij}$, are the inverse of the quadratic elongations, $1/\lambda_i$. The diagonal components of the Lagrangian and Eulerian finite strain tensors, $E_{ij}$ and $\bar{E}_{ij}$, can be found from Eqs. {eq}`ch08_eq38` and {eq}`ch08_eq39`.

Notice that for computing the maximum shear strain, the function assumes plane strain (Ramsay, 1967).

# ### Mohr circle for finite strain
# 
# The finite strain and deformation tensors are symmetric tensors. Therefore, a rotation about one of the principal axis of the tensor can be represented by a Mohr circle. As you may suspect, there are Mohr circles for finite strain in the undeformed and deformed configuration (Ramsay, 1967). For geoscientists, the Mohr circle for finite strain in the deformed configuration is the most important, since in nature we do observe deformed rocks.
# 
# To derive this Mohr circle, we can start with the Cauchy deformation tensor in a principal axes coordinate system:

# $$
# \bar{C}_{i j}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}\bar{C}_{1} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \bar{C}_{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \bar{C}_{3}\end{array}\right]
# $$ (ch08_eq40)

# and perform a rotation $\theta$ about $\mathbf{X_2}$, which is described by the transformation matrix:

# $$
# a_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta&0&\sin\theta\\0&1&0\\-\sin\theta&0&\cos\theta\end{pmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq41)

# The tensor transformation equation is:

# $$
# \bar{C}_{ij}' = a_{ik}a_{jl}\bar{C}_{kl}
# $$ (ch08_eq42)

# which results in the new form of the tensor:

# $$
# \bar{C}'_{ij}=\begin{bmatrix}\bar{C}_1\cos^2\theta+\bar{C}_3\sin^2\theta&0&-(\bar{C}_1-\bar{C}_3)\sin\theta\cos\theta\\0&\bar{C}_2&0\\-(\bar{C}_1-\bar{C}_3)\sin\theta\cos\theta&0&\bar{C}_1\sin^2\theta+\bar{C}_3\cos^2\theta\end{bmatrix}
# $$ (ch08_eq43)

# Upon rearranging, we get:

# $$
# \begin{gathered}
#     \bar{C}_{11}'=\frac{\bar{C}_1+\bar{C}_3}{2}+\frac{\bar{C}_1-\bar{C}_3}{2}\cos 2\theta  \\
#     \bar{C}_{33}'=\frac{\bar{C}_1+\bar{C}_3}{2}-\frac{\bar{C}_1-\bar{C}_3}{2}\cos 2\theta \\
#     \bar{C}_{13}'=\bar{C}_{31}'=-\frac{\bar{C}_1-\bar{C}_3}{2}\sin 2\theta
# \end{gathered}
# $$ (ch08_eq44)

# As stated in Eq. {eq}`ch08_eq39`, $\bar{C}_{ii} = 1/\lambda_i$. Also $\bar{C}_{ij}$ for $i \neq j$ is equal to $\gamma / \lambda$. Using $\lambda ' = 1/\lambda$ and $\gamma ' = \gamma / \lambda$, we get the equations for the Mohr circle for finite strain in the deformed configuration:

# $$
# \begin{gathered}
#     \lambda^{\prime}=\frac{\left(\lambda_{1}^{\prime}+\lambda_{3}^{\prime}\right)}{2}+\frac{\left(\lambda_{1}^{\prime}-\lambda_{3}^{\prime}\right)}{2} \cos 2 \theta  \\
#     \gamma^{\prime}=-\frac{\left(\lambda_{1}^{\prime}-\lambda_{3}^{\prime}\right)}{2} \sin 2 \theta
# \end{gathered}
# $$ (ch08_eq45)

# As an example, {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`a shows a deformed circle and an inscribed triangle after 30$^o$ clockwise shear. {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b shows the Mohr circle for this deformation. In the Mohr circle, the horizontal axis is $\lambda'$, and the vertical axis is $\gamma'$. We follow the convention of Ragan (2009): Positive angular shear, $\psi$, corresponds to anticlockwise rotation of the original lineâ€™s normal ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`a), and the $\gamma'$ axis in the Mohr circle increases downwards ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b). Notice that the angle between the horizontal axis and a line from the origin to any point in the Mohr circle is equal to $\psi$. Therefore, a line from the origin and tangent to the Mohr circle indicates $\psi_{\text{max}}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b).

# ```{figure} /figures/ch08_fig07.png
# :width: 600px
# :name: ch08_fig07
# 
# **a.** Physical plane, and **b.** Mohr circle for 30Â° clockwise shear of a circle and a triangle. The pole, the triangle bisectors a, b and c (red and blue), the principal strain axes $S_{1}$ and $S_{3}$ (black), the LNFE (green), and the lines of maximum shear strain (orange) are all drawn in the Mohr circle.
# ```

# From points in the Mohr circle, one can trace the corresponding lines with the same orientation than in the physical plane ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b, triangle bisectors a, b and c). These lines will intersect at a point called the *pole* to the Mohr circle ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b). From the pole, one can trace lines of any orientation; they will intersect the circle at points that represent the strain of lines with the same orientation in the physical plane. Thus, you can imagine the pole to be the center of the strain ellipse, and from it, it is easy to trace the principal axes of strain ($S_1$ and $S_3$), the lines of no finite elongation (LNFE, $\lambda'=1$), and the lines of maximum shear strain ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig07>`b).

# ### 2D finite strain from displacement data
# 
# If we have a group of points or stations with displacement data, we can determine the finite strain following a strategy similar to the one we used for infinitesimal strain. The function [grid_fin_strain](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/grid_fin_strain.py) computes and plots the finite strain for a group of points with displacement data. This function is very similar to our previous function `grid_strain`, and therefore we only include its header here. Notice that after computing the displacement gradient in the undeformed (`frame` = 0) or deformed (`frame` = 1) configuration, we use our function `fin_strain` to compute the finite strain in each cell.

The file [demfault.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch8-3/demfault.txt) contains the deformed $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the elements and their displacements in meters. The notebook [ch8-3](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/notebooks/ch8-3.ipynb) shows the solution to this problem using the nearest neighbor method:

# The maximum shear strain delineates the internal structure of the fault. You can find more information about computing strain from displacement or velocity data in Cardozo and Allmendinger (2009).

# (ch08-5)=
# ## Progressive strain
# 
# We have focused so far on the undeformed (initial) and deformed (final) states. However, finite strain is actually the cumulative result of a series of strain increments:

# $$
# \begin{aligned}{ }^{1} x_{i} &={ }^{1} F_{i j}{ }^{1} X_{j} \\{ }^{2} X_{i} &={ }^{1} x_{i} \\{ }^{2} x_{i} &={ }^{2} F_{i j}{ }^{2} X_{j} \\{ }^{3} X_{i} &={ }^{2} x_{i} \\{ }^{3} x_{i} &={ }^{3} F_{i j}{ }^{3} X_{j} \\ \cdots \\{ }^{n} x_{i} &={ }^{n} F_{i j}{ }^{n} X_{j} \end{aligned}
# $$ (ch08_eq46)

# where $F_{ij}$ is the Green deformation gradient, and $1$ to $n$ are the strain increments. This can also be written as:

# $$
# x_{i}={ }^{n} F_{i j} \ldots{ }^{3} F_{i j}{ }^{2} F_{i j}{ }^{1} F_{i j}{ }^{1} X_{j}
# $$ (ch08_eq47)

# Notice that since ${ }^{2}\mathbf{F}{ }^{1}\mathbf{F}\neq{ }^{1}\mathbf{F}{ }^{2}\mathbf{F}$, for finite strain we must know the order of deformation. For example, if we want to determine the finite strain of a group of faults in a region, we must know the order at which these faults formed. This is often very difficult to determine.
# 
# Letâ€™s look at some simple deformations, which are characterized by the same incremental deformation gradient through time. For simplicity, we will assume that there is no strain along the $\mathbf{X_2}$ axis, and all strain is in the $\mathbf{X_1}\mathbf{X_3}$ plane. Thus, we will be dealing with plane strain.

# (ch08-5-1)=
# ### Pure shear
# 
# For pure shear, the principal stretches are along the coordinate axes (e.g. {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig02>`). Letâ€™s assume the maximum principal stretch, $S_1$, is along $\mathbf{X_1}$, and the minimum principal strecth, $S_3$, is along $\mathbf{X_3}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig08>`a). $S_2 = 1$ (plane strain) and is parallel to $\mathbf{X_2}$. The Green deformation gradient for this case is:

# $$
# { }^{PS}F_{ij}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}S_{1} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & S_{3}\end{array}\right]
# $$ (ch08_eq48)

# ```{figure} /figures/ch08_fig08.png
# :width: 600px

# **a.** Pure shear, and **b.** Simple shear. Blue is undeformed, and red is deformed geometry. Large white and gray circles are initial and final positions, respectively. The displacement paths of the points are divided in 10 increments. Modified from Allmendinger et al. (2012).
# ```

# The function [pure_shear](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/pure_shear.py) deforms a collection of points using pure shear, a value of $S_1$ (`st1`), and assuming plane strain and area conservation ($S_1S_3 = 1$). The function displays the pointsâ€™ displacement paths for a number of increments (`ninc`), and the progressive strain history as the value of $S_1$ versus the angle $S_1$ makes with the $\mathbf{X_1}$ axis ($\Theta$). The last two parameters are computed from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Green deformation tensor:

# In this case, the principal strain axes, $S_1$ and $S_3$, rotate throughout the deformation. $\Theta$ is initially 45(as predicted by infinitesimal strain, {numref}`Figure %s <ch08_fig04>`), and it progressively decreases to a value of 20by the end of the deformation. Simple shear is a *rotational* deformation.

# (ch08-5-3)=
# ### General shear
# 
# Sub-simple shear (De Paor, 1983), or general shear, is a combination of pure shear and simple shear. If the shear direction and $S_1$ are parallel to $\mathbf{X_1}$, $S_2 = 1$ (plane strain), and area is constant, the Green deformation gradient is (Allmendinger et al., 2012):

# $$
# { }^{GS}F_{i j}=\left[\begin{array}{lll}S_1 & 0 & \frac{\gamma(S_1-S_3)}{2\ln S_1} \\ 0 & 1 & \quad\: 0 \\ 0 & 0 &\quad\: S_3\end{array}\right]
# $$ (ch08_eq50)

# If the shear direction is parallel to $\mathbf{X_1}$, but $S_1$ is parallel to $\mathbf{X_3}$, the Green deformation gradient is (Allmendinger et al., 2012):

# $$
# { }^{GS}F_{i j}=\left[\begin{array}{lll}S_3 & 0 & \frac{\gamma(S_3-S_1)}{2\ln S_3} \\ 0 & 1 & \quad\: 0 \\ 0 & 0 &\quad\: S_1\end{array}\right]
# $$ (ch08_eq51)

# A simple dimensionless measure of the ratio of simple to pure shear is the cosine of the acute angle between the eigenvectors of the Green deformation gradient $\mathbf{F}$. This measure is known as the *kinematic vorticity number*, $W_k$ (Truesdell, 1953). General shear is characterized by a $W_k$ between 0 (pure shear) and 1 (simple shear).
# 
# The function [general_shear](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/general_shear.py) deforms a collection of points using general shear and values of $S_1$ (`st1`) and $\gamma$ (`gamma`), for a shear direction parallel to $\mathbf{X_1}$, and $S_1$ parallel (`kk` = 0) or perpendicular to the shear direction (`kk` = 1). Similar to the two previous functions, `general_shear` displays the pointsâ€™ displacement paths for a number of increments (`ninc`), and $S_1$ versus $\Theta$:

# ## Exercises
# 
# 1. This exercise is from Rowland and Duebendorfer (1994). The file [bar.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch8-exercise1/bar.txt) contains the strike and dip (RHR), slip direction, and slip sense of faults within the Basin and Range province, specifically southern Nevada and the Lake Mead area. Plot the **P** and **T** axes for these data using the function `pt_axes`. Are these data consistent with the regional E-W extension direction in the Basin and Range province?
# 
# 2. From the **P** and **T** axes, one can compute an unweighted moment tensor summation as follows (Allmendinger et al., 1989):
# 
#     $$
#     \scriptstyle \mathbf{K} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}\scriptstyle\sum (P_N)^{2} - (T_N)^{2}  & \scriptstyle\sum (P_N) (P_E) - (T_N) (T_E) & \scriptstyle\sum (P_N) (P_D) - (T_N) (T_D) \\ \scriptstyle\sum (P_E) (P_N) - (T_E) (T_N) & \scriptstyle\sum (P_E)^{2} - (T_E)^{2} & \scriptstyle\sum (P_E) (P_D) - (T_E) (T_D) \\ \scriptstyle\sum (P_D) (P_N) - (T_D) (T_N) & \scriptstyle\sum (P_D) (P_E) - (T_D) (T_E) & \scriptstyle\sum (P_D)^{2} - (T_D)^{2}\end{array}\right]
#     $$ (ch08_eq52)
# 
#     where the subscripts $N$, $E$, and $D$ refer to the east, north and  down direction cosines of the **P** and **T** axes. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $\mathbf{K}$ give the relative magnitudes and orientations of the kinematic axes. These kinematic axes define the orientation of two nodal planes, or possible faults, separating the areas of infinitesimal extension (**T** axes) from those of infinitesimal shortening (**P** axes). The faults intersect at the intermediate eigenvector, the minimum and maximum eigenvectors define the movement plane, and the faults slip vectors are on the movement plane at 45 from the minimum and maximum eigenvectors. Modify the function `pt_axes` to plot the nodal planes. This is not a simple problem, donâ€™t give up.
# 
# 3. The file [andes.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch8-exercise2/andes.txt) contains GPS data (stations UTM coordinates and displacements in meters) from the Central Andes (Kendrick et al., 2001; Brooks et al., 2003). Compute the infinitesimal rotation in this region using the function `grid_strain`. What does the rotation tell you about the tectonics of this region? Check Allmendinger et al. (2005) to support your answer.
# 
# 4. The file [antithetic.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch8-exercise3/antithetic.txt) contains data from a discrete element model of a low angle normal fault (deformed elementsâ€™ coordinates and displacements). Use the function `grid_fin_strain` to compute the shear strain of this model.
# 
# 5. The file [trilobite.txt](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/data/ch8-exercise4/trilobite.txt) contains the undeformed $x$ and $y$ coordinates of points delineating a trilobite specimen. Deform the trilobite using **a.** pure shear with $S_1 = 2.0$, **b.** simple shear with $\gamma = 1.0$, and **c.** general shear with $S_1 = 1.5$, $\gamma = 1.0$, and shear direction and $S_1$ parallel to $x$.
