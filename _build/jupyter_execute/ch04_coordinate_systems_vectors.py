# # Coordinate systems and vectors

# Strike and dip, and trend and plunge, are a convenient way to represent the orientation of planes and lines. However, it is difficult to handle these measurements using computation. In this chapter, we will see how to convert linear features (lines and poles to planes) from spherical (trend and plunge) to Cartesian (direction cosines) coordinates, thus representing these features as vectors. This facilitates the analysis of planes and lines using linear algebra and computation, and it will allow us to solve a range of interesting problems using vector operations.

# (ch04-1)=
# ## Coordinate systems
# 
# Any point or location in space can be represented by the coordinates of the point with respect to the three orthogonal axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. We will call the axes of this coordinate system $\mathbf{X_1}$, $\mathbf{X_2}$ and $\mathbf{X_3}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig01>`). In addition, we will follow a right-handed naming convention: If you hold your right hand so that your thumb points in the positive direction of the first axis $\mathbf{X_1}$, your other fingers should curl from the positive direction of the second axis $\mathbf{X_2}$ toward the positive direction of the third axis $\mathbf{X_3}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig01>`). Such a coordinate system is called a right-handed coordinate system.
# 
# In geosciences, we use mainly two types of right-handed coordinate systems: An east (**E**), north (**N**), up (**U**) coordinate system ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig01>`a), and a north (**N**), east (**E**), down (**D**) coordinate system ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig01>`b). The **ENU** coordinate system is used in GIS and Geophysics when dealing with elevations (e.g. topography), while the **NED** coordinate system is used in Structural Geology where, by convention, angles measured downwards from the horizontal (e.g. plunge of a downward pointing line) are considered positive. In this chapter, we will use mainly the **NED** coordinate system, but when dealing with topography and elevations, we will use the **ENU** coordinate system.

# ## Vectors
# 
# (ch04-2-1)=
# ### Vector components, magnitude, and unit vectors
# 
# A line from the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system to a point in space is the position vector of the point. A *vector* is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction. Displacement, velocity, force, acceleration, and poles to planes, are all vectors. A vector is defined by its three components with respect to the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system; these are the projections of the vector onto the axes $\mathbf{X_1}$, $\mathbf{X_2}$ and $\mathbf{X_3}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig02>`a).

# ```{figure} /figures/ch04_fig02.png
# :width: 600px
# :name: ch04_fig02
# 
# **a.** Components of a vector. **b.** Direction cosines of a unit vector. Modified from Allmendinger et al. (2012).
# ```

# This is expressed by the following equation:
# 
# $$
# \mathbf{v} = [v_1,v_2,v_3]
# $$ (ch04_eq01)
# 
# We use lower capital, bold letters to denote vectors. The magnitude (length) of a vector can be computed using Pythagorasâ€™ theorem:
# 
# $$
# v = \left(v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2 \right)^{1/2}
# $$ (ch04_eq02)
# 
# The result is just a number or scalar. We use regular, non-capital letters to denote scalars. If we divide each of the components of a vector by its magnitude, the result is a unit vector, a vector with the same orientation but with a magnitude (length) of one ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig02>`b):
# 
# $$
# \mathbf{\hat{v}} = \left[\frac{v_1}{v}, \frac{v_2}{v}, \frac{v_3}{v} \right]
# $$ (ch04_eq03)
# 
# We use a hat to indicate unit vectors. There is a very interesting property of unit vectors; the components of a unit vector are the cosines of the angles the vector makes with the axes of the coordinate system ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig02>`b):
# 
# $$
# \mathbf{\hat v} = [\cos\alpha,\cos\beta,\cos\gamma]
# $$ (ch04_eq04)
# 
# these are called the *direction cosines* of the vector. By convention, $\cos\alpha$ is the direction cosine of the vector with respect to $\mathbf{X_1}$, $\cos\beta$ is the direction cosine of the vector with respect to $\mathbf{X_2}$, and $\cos\gamma$ is the direction cosine of the vector with respect to $\mathbf{X_3}$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig02>`b).
# 
# In Python, we can use the NumPy `linalg.norm` function to compute the magnitude of a vector, and convert the vector to a unit vector as illustrated in the following notebook [ch4-1](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/notebooks/ch4-1.ipynb):

# In[1]:


# Import numpy
import numpy as np
from numpy import linalg as la  # Import linear algebra functions


# Make vector
v = np.array([1,2,3])
print("Vector:", v)

# Magnitude of the vector
length = la.norm(v) 
print("Magnitude of the vector:", length)

# Unit vector
v_hat = v / length
print("Unit Vector:", v_hat)

# Magnitude of unit vector
length = la.norm(v_hat) 
print("Magnitude of the unit vector:", length)


# (ch04-2-2)=
# ### Vector operations
# 
# To multiply a scalar times a vector, just multiply each component of the vector by the scalar:
# 
# $$
# x\mathbf v = [xv_1, xv_2, xv_3]
# $$ (ch04_eq06)
# 
# This operation is useful, for example, to reverse the direction of a vector; just multiply the vector by -1. To add two vectors, just sum their components:
# 
# $$
# \mathbf u + \mathbf v = \mathbf v + \mathbf u = [u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2, u_3 + v_3]
# $$(ch04_eq06)
# 
# Vector addition is commutative but vector subtraction is not. Vector addition and subtraction obey the parallelogram rule, whereby the resulting vector bisects the two vectors to be added or subtracted ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig03>`a).

# ```{figure} /figures/ch04_fig03.png
# :width: 600px
# :name: ch04_fig03
# 
# **a.** Vector addition and subtraction. **b.** Cross product of two unit vectors. Modified from Allmendinger et al. (2012).
# ```

# There are two operations that are unique to vectors: the *dot product* and the *cross product*. The result of the dot product is a scalar and is equal to the magnitude of the first vector times the magnitude of the second vector times the cosine of the angle between the vectors:
# 
# $$
# \mathbf u \cdot\mathbf v = \mathbf v \cdot\mathbf u = uv\cos\theta = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3 = u_iv_i
# $$ (ch04_eq07)
# 
# The dot product is commutative. If the two vectors are unit vectors, you can easily see that the dot product is the cosine of the angle between the vectors:
# 
# $$
# \mathbf{\hat u} \cdot\mathbf{\hat v} = \cos\theta = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + u_3v_3
# $$ (ch04_eq08)
# 
# or in terms of the direction cosines of the vectors:
# 
# $$
# \mathbf{\hat u} \cdot\mathbf{\hat v} = \cos\theta = cos\alpha_1\cos\alpha_2 + \cos\beta_1\cos\beta_2 + \cos\gamma_1\cos\gamma_2
# $$ (ch04_eq09)
# 
# which as we will see later, it is a great way to find the angle between two unit vectors.
# 
# The result of the cross product is another vector. This vector is perpendicular to the other two vectors, and it has a magnitude equal to the product of the magnitudes of the vectors times the sine of the angle between the vectors:
# 
# $$
# \mathbf u\times\mathbf v = uv\sin\theta\mathbf{\hat l} = [u_2v_3 - u_3v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1]
# $$ (ch04_eq10)
# 
# The cross product is not commutative. If the vectors are unit vectors, the length of the resulting vector is equal to the sine of the angle between the vectors ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig03>`b). The new vector obeys a right-hand rule; for $\mathbf u\times\mathbf v$, the fingers curl from $\mathbf u$ towards $\mathbf v$ and the thumb points in the direction of the resulting vector, and vice versa ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig03>`b).
# 
# In Python, these operations are easy to perform using the NumPy library as shown in the following notebook [ch4-2](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/notebooks/ch4-2.ipynb):

# In[2]:


# Import numpy

print("3 * u =", sv)

# Sum of vectors

print("u + v =", vsum)

#  Dot product of vectors
dotp = np.dot(u,v)
print("u . v =", dotp)

# Cross product of vectors
crossp = np.cross(u,v) 
print("u x v =", crossp)


# (ch04-3)=
# ## Geological features as vectors
# 
# We have now all the mathematical tools needed to represent geological features as vectors. Since we are only interested in the orientation of these features, we will treat lines (and poles to planes) as unit vectors. We will also use the Structural Geology **NED** coordinate system.

# (ch04-3-1)=
# ### From spherical to Cartesian coordinates
# 
# {numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig04>` shows a line as a unit vector $\mathbf{\hat{v}}$ in the **NED** coordinate system. Clearly, the angle that the line makes with the **D** axis is $90^o - \textit{plunge}$, therefore:

# ```{figure} /figures/ch04_fig04.png
# :width: 450px
# :name: ch04_fig04
# 
# Diagram showing the relations between the trend and plunge and the direction cosines in the **NED** coordinate system. Gray plane is the vertical plane in which the plunge is measured. Modified from Allmendinger et al. (2012).
# ```

# $$
# \cos\gamma=\cos(90^o - plunge) = \sin(plunge)
# $$ (ch04_eq11)
# 
# The horizontal projection of the line is $\cos(plunge)$ ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig04>`). $\cos\alpha$ and $\cos\beta$ are just the **N** and **E** components of this horizontal line and ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig04>`):
# 
# $$
# \cos\alpha = \cos(trend)\cos(plunge)
# $$ (ch04_eq12)
# 
# $$
# \cos\beta = \cos(90^o - trend)\cos(plunge) = \sin(trend)\cos(plunge)
# $$ (ch04_eq13)
# 
# {numref}`ch04_tab01` summarizes these equations.

# ```{list-table} From spherical to Cartesian coordinates of lines and poles.
# :header-rows: 1

# * - **E**
#   - $\cos\beta=\sin(trend)\cos(plunge)$
# * - **D**
#   - $\cos\gamma=\sin(plunge)$
# ```

# The magnitude and sign of the direction cosines tell us a lot about the orientation of the line ({numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig05>`). A horizontal line (plunge = 0) has $\cos\gamma=0$, a downward line (plunge $>0$) has positive $\cos\gamma$, and a vertical line (plunge = 90) has $\cos\gamma=1$ ($\cos\alpha$ and $\cos\beta$ are 0). A horizontal or downward line has positive $\cos\alpha$ if it trends to the north (first or fourth quadrants), and positive $\cos\beta$ if it trends to the east (first or second quadrants). If the line trends exactly N or S, $\cos\beta=0$; and if the line trends exactly E or W, $\cos\alpha=0$.

# ### From Cartesian to spherical coordinates
# 
# Converting from direction cosines (Cartesian coordinates) to trend and plunge (spherical coordinates) is a little less straightforward. The plunge is easy:
# 
# $$
# plunge = \sin^{-1}(\cos\gamma)
# $$ (ch04_eq14)
# 
# The trend can be determined as follows:
# 
# $$
# \frac{\cos\beta}{\cos\alpha} = \frac{\sin(trend)\cos(plunge)}{\cos(trend)\cos(plunge)} = \tan(trend)
# $$ (ch04_eq15)
# 
# or:
# 
# $$
# trend = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\cos\beta}{\cos\alpha}\right)
# $$ (ch04_eq16)
# 
# The problem is that the trend varies from 0 and 360. For the $\tan^{-1}$ function, there are two possible angles between 0 and 360. Which one should we use? The answer is to use the signs of the direction cosines to determine in which quadrant the trend lies within. By inspection of {numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig05>`, one can see that:
# 
# $$
# trend = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\cos\beta}{\cos\alpha}\right),\textit{if}\, \cos\alpha > 0
# $$ (ch04_eq17)
# 
# $$
# trend = 180^o + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\cos\beta}{\cos\alpha}\right),\textit{if}\, \cos\alpha < 0
# $$ (ch04_eq18)

# 
# $$

# ### Mean vector
# 
# An important problem in geosciences is to determine the average or mean vector that represents a group of lines. These lines can be for example poles to bedding, paleocurrent directions, paleomagnetic poles, or slip vectors on a fault surface. This problem can be solved using vector addition. The resultant vector $\mathbf{r}$ of the sum of the $N$ unit vectors representing the lines has components:
# 
# $$
# r_1 = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\alpha_i\qquad r_2 = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\beta_i\qquad r_3 = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\gamma_i
# $$ (ch04_eq21)
# 
# where $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the direction cosines of the unit vectors. The length of the resultant vector $\mathbf{r}$ is:
# 
# $$
# r = \sqrt{r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2}
# $$ (ch04_eq22)
# 
# and the direction cosines of the unit vector that is parallel to the mean of the individual vectors are:
# 
# $$
# \overline{\alpha} = \frac{r_1}{r}\qquad \overline{\beta} = \frac{r_2}{r}\qquad \overline{\gamma} = \frac{r_3}{r}
# $$ (ch04_eq23)
# 
# These direction cosines define the orientation of the mean vector. The mean resultant length $\overline{r}$ measures how concentrated the individual vectors are or how representative the mean vector is:
# 
# $$
# \overline{r} = \frac{r}{N}\qquad where\qquad 0\leq\overline{r}\leq 1
# $$ (ch04_eq24)
# 
# The closer this value is to 1, the better the concentration. The function [calc_mv](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/calc_mv.py) calculates the mean vector for a series of lines. It also calculates the Fisher statistics for the mean vector (Fisher et al., 1987), which is the standard way to represent uncertainties in this analysis. Notice that `calc_mv` uses our two previous functions `sph_to_cart` and `cart_to_sph` to convert from spherical to Cartesian coordinates, and vice versa.

# ### Three points problem
# 
# The three points problem is a fundamental problem in geology. It is based on the fact that three non-collinear points on a plane define the orientation of the plane. The graphical solution to this problem is introduced early in Geosciences. It involves finding the strike line (a line connecting two points of equal elevation) on the plane, and the dip from two strike lines (two structure contours) on the plane.
# 
# However, there is an easier and more accurate solution to this problem using linear algebra: The three points on the plane define two lines, and the cross product between these lines is parallel to the pole to the plane, from which the orientation of the plane can be estimated. The function [three_points](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/three_points.py) computes the strike and dip of a plane from the east (**E**), north (**N**), and up (**U**) coordinates of three points on the plane:

# Letâ€™s use this function in the following problem. The geologic map in {numref}`Figure %s <ch04_fig06>` shows a sequence of sedimentary units dipping south (you can deduce this by the outcrop V in the valley). Points 1, 2 and 3 are located on the base of unit S and their **ENU** coordinates are:

# ## Uncertainties
# 
# As we saw in [Section 3.2.5](ch03-2-5), the strike and dip or trend and plunge measurements have errors ({numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig06>` and {numref}`Figure %s <ch03_fig07>`), and these errors propagate in any computation making use of these angles. Also, as accurate as GPS and elevation measurements are today, they also have errors. Thus, the functions in the module `angles` and the function `three_points` lack this important element of uncertainty.
# 
# Suppose that $x, ..., z$ are measured with uncertainties (or errors) $\delta x, ..., \delta z$ and the measured values are used to compute the function $q(x,...,z)$. If the uncertainties in $x, ..., z$ are independent and random, then the uncertainty (or error) in $q$ is (Taylor, 1997):

# $$
# \delta q=\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}\delta x \right)^2+...+\left(\frac{\partial q}{\partial z}\delta z \right)^2}
# $$ (ch04_eq25)

# This formula is easy to calculate for a few operations, but it can become quite difficult for a long chain of operations. Fortunately, there is a Python package that handles calculations with numbers with uncertainties. This package is called `uncertainties` and it was developed by Eric Lebigot. You can find details about the package as well as instructions for installing it in the [uncertainties](https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/) website. You can install the uncertainties package by entering in a terminal:
# 
# ``` bash
# pip install --upgrade uncertainties
# ```
# 
# After this, you can use the uncertainties package. The module [angles_u](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/angles_u.py) and the function [three_points_u](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/functions/three_points_u.py) in the resource git repository, are the corresponding `angles` module and `three_points` function with uncertainties. We donâ€™t list these here, but rather illustrate their use in the following notebook [ch4-6](https://github.com/nfcd/compGeo/blob/master/source/notebooks/ch4-6.ipynb).
