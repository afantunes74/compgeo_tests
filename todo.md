# TODOs

Here follows a list of some major TODOs planned to be implemented next:

- **main**: define and include a logo;
- **main**: translate to Brazilian Portuguese;
- **functions**: [*sugestion*] in order to simplify code maintenance, remove function declarations from chapters, leaving them only in their respective modules;
- **functions**: group functions responsible for performing similar tasks into broader modules (e.g.: group functions `general_shear`, `pure_shear` and `simple_shear` into a module called `shear`);
- **functions**: format function docstrings according to Numpy's standard;
- **functions**: enable hyperlinks to access functions within chapters;
- **notebooks**: make Jupyter notebooks executable;
- **notebooks**: enable hyperlinks to access Jupyter notebooks within chapters;
- **bibliography**: manage citations and references with BibTeX;
